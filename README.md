A C++ and Python shim for a subset of the Starlink AST astronomical library

The focus is on support for spatial mappings for use by LSST.
The supported build system is LSST DM's scons-based build system.

See `docs/main.dox` for more information.
Better yet, build the documentation with `doxygen doc/doxygen.conf`
and see `docs/html/index.html`.
